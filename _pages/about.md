# About FundusAI

FundusAI helps prevent blindness in diabetic patients by proving an automated diagnostic system that allows more patients to be diagnosed in less time.

FundusAI solves three major problems: the scarcity of eye doctors, which is solved by our AI solution, the high cost of diagnostic tools, which is solved by our low-cost diagnostic device that captures eye images, and the time-consuming manual diagnosis, which is solved by a combination of fast eye image capturing and diagnosis.
