# About FundusAI

FundusAI offers an Artificial Intelligence Diagnostic Device for Diabetic Retinopathy, allowing doctors to diagnose more patients in less time in order to prevent blindness in diabetic patients.

FundusAI solves three major problems: the scarcity of eye doctors, which is solved by our AI solution, the high cost of diagnostic tools, which is solved by our low-cost diagnostic device that captures eye images, and the time-consuming manual diagnosis, which is solved by a combination of fast eye image capturing and diagnosis.
